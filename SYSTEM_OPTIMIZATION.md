# Dadir Defender: LLM Optimization Feature Checklist

This checklist tracks the implementation of features aimed at optimizing your laptop for running local LLMs (e.g., Ollama) and general developer performance. Check off each feature as you implement it!

---

## Core System Optimization Features

- [ ] **Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs**  
  Prevent non-essential applications from launching at boot to maximize RAM and CPU for LLM workloads.

- [ ] **Visual Performance Mode**  
  Option to automatically turn off Windows visual effects and animations to free up system resources.

- [ ] **Smart Storage Sense**  
  Enable/configure Windows Storage Sense to auto-delete temporary files and keep disk space free.

- [x] **Drive Optimization**  
  Integrate or trigger built-in drive optimization (defrag/trim) for storage health.

- [ ] **Background App Guard**  
  Detect and block non-essential apps from running in the background, reducing RAM/CPU usage.

- [ ] **Process Priority Manager**  
  Automatically set high priority for LLM processes and lower priority for non-essential apps.

- [ ] **RAM Usage Optimizer**  
  Clear standby memory and optimize RAM allocation when memory usage exceeds threshold.

- [ ] **Browser Tab Limiter**  
  Warn or limit the number of open browser tabs when LLM models are running.

- [ ] **Software Cleanup Assistant**  
  Scan for and assist in removing unused or rarely-used software.

- [ ] **Windows Services Optimizer**  
  Disable unnecessary Windows services that consume resources in the background.

- [x] **Scheduled Restart Reminder**  
  Remind or schedule regular system restarts to clear temp data and refresh memory.

## Advanced LLM Mode (“Ollama-Ready Boost”)

- [x] **Resource Monitor & Bottleneck Detector**  
  Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, Disk, and GPU usage. Alert for performance bottlenecks.

- [ ] **Virtual Memory (Page File) Optimizer**  
  Check and recommend/set optimal virtual memory settings for LLM workloads.

- [x] **Temporary File Cleaner**  
  One-click or scheduled clearing of system and app temp files.

- [ ] **Driver & System Update Checker**  
  Ensure GPU and system drivers are up-to-date for LLM compatibility.

- [ ] **Lightweight Dev Tools Advisor**  
  Suggest lightweight alternatives to heavy IDEs/tools when RAM is low.

- [ ] **Ollama Model Resource Manager**  
  Help users select model sizes and set resource limits; recommend quantized models for limited hardware.

- [ ] **Project & Log Cleaner**  
  Find and delete large, old, or unused project folders, logs, and caches (node_modules, .venv, Docker images, etc.).

- [ ] **Indexing Optimizer**  
  Disable Windows search indexing for large development/code folders.

- [ ] **Heavy App Conflict Alert**  
  Warn if multiple heavy apps or LLMs are running together, risking system overload.

- [ ] **GPU Memory Monitor**  
  Track GPU VRAM usage and alert when approaching limits for LLM workloads.

- [ ] **Power Plan Optimizer**  
  Automatically switch to High Performance power plan when running intensive tasks.

## Stretch/Future Features

- [x] **Automated Script Runner**  
  One-click system cleanup and optimization before LLM/model usage.

- [ ] **Direct LLM Runtime Integration**  
  Deeper optimization/integration with Ollama and other LLM tools and runtimes.

- [ ] **Optimization History & Analytics**  
  Show resource usage and optimization history for continuous improvement.

- [ ] **Quick Performance Profiles**  
  One-click switching between "Gaming", "Development", "LLM", and "Battery Saver" modes.

- [ ] **Network Bandwidth Monitor**  
  Monitor and limit background network usage to prioritize LLM model downloads.
